##Â What is radio?

What counts as radio tends to slip away a bit so we're working with the rough definition:

An experience of continuous audio which you seldom interact with, that forms a background to other activities but which you sometimes focus in and concentrate on. It's often but not always a physical device.

## Ideas

* second screen synced visual radio (images or video or text linked to programmes, adding to the experience but not required for it)
* second screen controls (change channel - on the radio - or switch to any of the services on iplayer radio using your phone as a remote control)
* radio for the blind (a physical button press speaks the programme and channel, and speaking reminders can be set using e.g. button press at current programme)
* 'radio bore' (press a button and it tells you facts about what's happening)
* modular exploded radio: speakers in one place, interfaces in other parts of the room
* completely programmable radio for perfectionists - time when it goes on and off, what it switches to at which time, when it plays podcasts etc
* alerts for certain topics, have it switch over automatically
* play on-demand programme from trailer
* beautiful visualisations
* beautiful physical devices

* archers (/ Today programme) panic button (click a button on the device to switch to a specified or random alternative channel using the schedule to determine when to switch back again) - *made as the (Archers Avoider)[../archers_avoider]* 
** needs more work to work out the best replacements for the avoided items
* shh! button
* news / now! weather / now buttons
* social radio like radiopop
* flip me to most popular channel every hour
* infinite trailers for radio (like / dislike buttons, gradually understanding you better, based around a channel but augmented with other things)
* predictive podcast downloads
* tweak the mood (more upbeat stuff)
* 'good news' radio

* making it easy for people to prototype interfaces and experiences
* replay radio from this day 10-20-30 years ago
* play everything on a topic

* Tv on the radio - synced pictures on a seocnd screen

* time travel radio - twist one knob for genre or channel and the other for going back in time through a schedule
** (time travel World service radio?)
* "not this!" (akin to archers avoider, but with permanent and temporary banning)
* learned / exciting filters
* autotune presenter voices
* John Peel radio?
* a kit (buy as a set, or a list of parts plus documentation) to allow you to make your own 'wrong radio'
* simple audio pairing of devices

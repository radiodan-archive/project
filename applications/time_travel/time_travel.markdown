# Time Travel Radio

This is an idea developed at Bristol Hackspace, initiated by Richard Sewell.

It has two dials:

* One allows you to pick the genre (or perhaps the channel)
* The other allows you to go back in time in the schedule to pick on-demand programmes to listen to
** Turning the dial fast goes day-by-day; slow goes programme-by-programme
* The radio communicates by speaking
